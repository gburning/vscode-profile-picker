# vscode-profile-picker

Based on [profile-selector](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GrzesiuS.profile-selector), this extension automatically triggers the profile picker for new windows and/or workspaces that haven't explicitly been assigned a profile.

<!-- TODO: Rename to vscode-auto-profile-picker or similar? -->
